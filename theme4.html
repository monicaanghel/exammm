            <h2>● Theme 04: Basic UX</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the last theme was to understand and experience how interaction between users and user interfaces works, as well as which theories, tools and methods you can use for research, design, testing and production of digital solutions for smartphones so that your work is based on specific insights about actual users instead of your own gut feelings and untenable assumptions.</p>
            <p>We learned about about javascript frameworks (for gestures) and online tools (for usertesting and research), how to work individually with the development of digital user interfaces, and to participate in ad hoc group work along the wayand in the last two weeks, we learned to take a part in teamwork around a more complex and cross-professional project than previous themes. Basically, now we used everything we learned so far, from sketching to testing, to prototype and produce.</p>
            <p>● The first part was Design Sprint. We began with a programme for a week, each day being reseved for something. We did sketches, we did crazy eights and storyboards.</p>

            <p>●● Step two: protptype.
                We discussed and tried many options and desided upon an app that is called "talkIT" it has a black bacground that can be switched to an white one if the user isn not happy with that, it was designed to create a group space, so that the students wouldn not need to use another apps or programmes to make their group assignments. It has the option to ask the teacher and it also shows the task description right on the group chat.</p>

            <p>●●● The third step was the native app. We chose to use the colors black and red as they are actual and different from the other combinations and also used the UI kits for iPhone X

            <p> We also got to present it and we were happy with the result, we even got a star!

            <p>●●●● The last step was the documantation. Each of us had to document during the four weeks everything that happened, so that in the end each of us would have its own documantation of the project.</p>

                <h1>First semester at KEA.</h1>
                <p> When I began my studies at KEA, I found out that I did not know a lot of the things that I was going to work with, but step by step, with a lot of work from the teachers and from my class mates, I managed to gather a lot of knowledge and during the semester I did some projects that I am pretty proud of, regarding my lack of knowledge in this area.

                <p> I was not good with all of this tasks at the beggining at all! So you can only imagine how important was the role of the teachers here. Everything was so good prepared and every theacher was so helpful that I really managed to understand the interesting and new things that were happening there. For example, this was my first moodboard.

            <p> But as I said, the teachers were always around and helped me to be able not just to do a better moodboard, but to build an entore website, to understand how it works, to know how important a color or a font is. That is when I found out how important is to attend the courses and first of all, a university of what you are interested in, because it helps a lot. So, this was my second moodboard! And that was just the start, if you are interested in seeing how the rest of the semester went for me, just <button id="seeportfolio"><a href="portfolio.html">click here</a></button>

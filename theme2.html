            <h2>●Theme02: Basic Content</h2>
            <p>●The purpose of this theme was to produce 2 short videos. First a short story on mobile phones and second an information video for an external collaboration partner. In the first assignment the focus was on image and composition and in the second assignmen,t the focus will be communication with video and video in a specific context.
            </p>
            <p>●In this theme we were introduced to basic principles for the composition and layout of digital media productions, practice-oriented design processes and documentation forms used in digital media productions and key forms of expression and content in digital media. As a result, during the theme we were able to apply basic theories, methods and tools to the design and development of user interfaces and apply and assess basic technologies and development environments for the development of user interfaces, including methods and technologies for version control. We learned the principals behind composing a picture frame for moving images and how different content types fits into an online context, how to develop it in iterative steps using treatment and storyboard to professionalise the production. </p>
            <p>●● First of all, we had to make an XD prototype each team about a different theme they cose.

            <p> After finishing this, we were split into another groups, for the following week, to make a video of a story without using words. We had very much fun filming it, as we had to come up with an idea for the story and a way to communicate it without telling any words.

            </p>
            <p> For the next week, we reunited our first groups and with the experience from our first video, we now had to make another, bigger and better one. We had to do it in a professional way so, of course, first we had a treatment.

            </p>
            <p>Then, there was our documentation, with everyone's link to our final website.

            </p>
            <p>●●●When all of this was done, there it was, our final micro site. With all the information, all the images and the most important: a very funny video about how helpful a bike in Copenhagen can be! To accomplish this, we put a lot of effort in filming the video from the right angles, we made sure to have a lot of them, to have where to coohe later, when editing, which was also a very interesting thing to do. But all in all, we discovered a lot of things about how to use a camera to get the best shots, how to edit a video, how to think a story and many other things!

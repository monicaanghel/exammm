            <h2>●Theme03: Basic Animation</h2>
            <p>●The third theme was about an interactive story, a style, character design animations and interactivity designed for a specific target group. Its purpose was to introduce concepts of basic animation, classic storytelling and character design as well as work with CSS animations and enhanced interactivity through Javascript. Here we learned to draw graphics with a consistent visual expression and a specific style, to sketch and draw graphics in Illustrator and Photoshop, that are open for further editing and used in a multimedia production, dramaturgical elements, character sheets and animation principles as the fundament for design decisions, ideation and brain storming, CSS animations and basic Javascript to enhance interactivity, Ccntrolling and using videos, audio and images of various types.

            </p>
            <p>●●For the first animation, I chose to enable "kyle", my character to jump, walk, shake and fade as well as a few other options. I chose to go with a button for each, to make it very easy to use.
                <img src="images/kyle.jpg" alt="kyle">
                <button id="kyle"><a href="http://monica-anghel.dk/Animation%20project/">Try the animation</a></button></p>

            <p>●●●For the next step, we had to do another animation, but this time, we had to draw our characters, backgrounds, create a story, and basically give life to an character, giving to it a name, a face, an age, some passions, everything.
                This time, I chose to create an alien. In the drawing process I used contrast firstly between the two types of children that find it difficult or even impossible to accept somebody different.

            </p>
            <p>●●●●For the next step, we had to realise, in teams, and interactive animation. We continued to work with animations, to develop and practice what we learned and to be able to make something better and better in the future.

            </p>
            <p>●●●●●Then, ProjectPool came. It was a team work about 2 tasks spread in 2 days, where er had to improve our coding and the new features that we learned. For the first, we made a calculator and for the second one, we made kind of a game, where the user has to try and catch the fly.

            <img src="images/game.jpg">
            <p>Considering we were prepared at that point, we received a new task. We made groups, the group that I took part of was called "The Bunnies" and it was the greatest thing to work with such good people. We started with a Collaboration agreement, to establish some rules and how things were going to go over the few weeks.

                <img src="images/coll.jpg"></p>

            <p>Next thing we had to do was a persona collage/ which meant we had to decide upon a target group and describe that as detailed as we could in a collage.
                <img src="images/collagep.png"></p>
            <p>For the final result, we decided to go with a story similar to Bugs Bunny stories, but, with our given style, which resulted Punks Bunny! We used color contrast to relate the difference between the punk style and the society's thinking about it. We also exagerated a lot the bunny and his room with punk posters and diferent items, to create a powerful contrast between the outside, the forest and the inside, bunny's room. The last, but not the least was the test. We used the think aloud test to see how our animation is seen and understood. We received very good feedback, the story having an easy understanding and everyone being able to make the connection between Punks and Bugs Bunny.

            <button id="bunny"><a href="http://monica-anghel.dk/PunksBunny%20new/bedroom.html">See animation</a></button>
            <p> To finish it in a goos way, we also had to make a screen documantation, where each of us explained our choices from this project.

            <h2>● Theme 01: Basic Web</h2>
            <p>●The purpose of the first theme was to cover the basics of web design from research and idea generation to design and communication on the web. So, we learned the basics of user interface design, digital communication, user testing, and responsive web design. As well as basic image processing in Photoshop, vector drawing Illustrator and coding with HTML and CSS .</p>
            <p>●In theme 01, we learned about the basic principles for the composition and layout of digital media productions, practice-oriented design processes and documentation forms used in digital media productions, digital exchange formats, f basic methods for modelling, structuring and developing digital user interfaces and key forms of expression and content in digital media.</p>
            <p>I was given the "punk" style and in addition to that, I chose to use black, grey and white images for the moodboard,
                the "Urban Jungle" and "CF Punk Forever" fonts for the typography. I chose this instead of using more color, to give the site a punk-rock look, with typography complementing it. <img src="images/PUNK%20MOODBOARD%202.2.png" alt="punk">
